link to my repo : https://github.com/fsu-sc/github-basics-team2/tree/al22bo

I tried different git commands like how to config git, clone a repo, create a new branch, compare changes for previous and new commits and how to revert back to the previous commit, push to a new branch, switch between branches, create a pull request
